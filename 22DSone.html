            <p style='font-size:30px; color:red;'> <i> ‚ÄúIn peace-time the scientist belongs to humanity, in war-time to his fatherland.‚Äù </i></p> - Fritz Haber



<p>
A controversial figurehead of science, Fritz Haber was the 1918 Nobel Laureate for Chemistry for his distinguished achievements alongside Carl Bosch. Together, they created the 1909 invention of the Haber-Bosch process, otherwise known as ammonia synthesis, which is still practised today. It is credited for its ability to create agricultural fertilizers to increase rations and munitions during war times due to the sparsity of nitrates at the time. Alongside Bosch, Fritz Haber‚Äôs unique aptitude for Chemistry enabled this well-respected discovery of making ‚Äúbread from air‚Äù (as he branded it). It fed and continues to feed billions of people, yet his unyielding desperation to help humanity had led the scientist down a much darker route.
</p>
<p>

Born in 1869, Haber grew up during Kaiser Willhelm‚Äôs reign as a German-Jewish man, later converting to Christianity in his youth. Contrary to Hitler‚Äôs administration, Kaiser Willhelm‚Äôs sovereignty allowed the social mobility of Jewish citizens, giving way to Haber‚Äôs extensive pursuit of knowledge in the sciences. In 1886, the young visionary attended the University of Heidelberg and worked with famed chemists of the time. In his years of education, Haber met Clara Immerwahr, another notable figure in history (the first woman ever to earn a doctorate in Chemistry in the University of Breslau). Soon, the two were married in 1901, and over a year later their first child was born. Fritz Haber seemingly had it all, but was barely scraping the climax of his career.
</p>
<p>

Soon after, Clara‚Äôs research soon became eclipsed by the very‚Äòhouse-wife‚Äô lifestyle she wanted to deviate from. As she fell, Haber had a new liberty in his life. He grew more involved with his studies, making a name for himself, even getting credit for his wife‚Äôs personal work. Throughout this period, she had constantly expressed her indignation towards the false praise he was receiving and the life she had at home. This would be the start of their unstable marriage.
</p>
<p>


In the meantime, the threat of world hunger had grown with scientists and the public desperate for solutions, which sparked the creation of the Haber-Bosch process. A process that started as Scientific curiosity and hunger, gradually transformed into loyalty to serve his German roots.
</p>
<p>
The 1909 success had granted him access to new facilities and new business endeavours. In 1911 the chemist was appointed as a professor of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Berlin, where he worked with the government, and other esteemed scientists to  conduct more research.
</p>
<p>


<p>
Tensions between Germany and other nations forced his team to develop new types of munitions to benefit the country's needs. Haber ended up being the first scientist to weaponize poison gas for his country, which, sadly, prolonged WWI by more than a year. Out of desperation, the German leadership acceded to his idea, and his research could finally serve ‚Äúthe motherland‚Äù. During this period, he established Haber‚Äôs law: a mathematical relationship that states that the toxicity of a poisonous gas depends on the concentration, and time duration of exposure.
</p>
<p>

On the 22nd of April 1915, the world's first major chemical weapons attack had finally occurred. Haber bore witness to his invention, supervising the deployment of 160 tonnes of chlorine gas upon the Western Front at Ypres, Belgium. More than 5,000 had suffered, with roughly 1,000 deaths on the battlefield alone. After chlorine, he assisted in the formation of phosgene gas, then mustard gas, and the list grew longer as more and more of Germany's war ambition had increased. His work acted as a catalyst for other chemical weapons by both allies and enemies.
</p>
<p>
Many scientists marvelled at Haber‚Äôs feats, while many others, including Clara Immerwahr, started to disagree. As an outspoken pacifist, she considered his work as ‚Äúa sign of barbarity, corrupting the very discipline which ought to bring new insights into life‚Äù, and a ‚Äúperversion of the ideals of science‚Äù. She publicly denounced his actions and pleaded for him to stop his pursuit of glory for Germany. Her statements fell on deaf ears. Unfortunately, the same night Haber celebrated his success of the first large scale Chlorine attack, was the same night Clara had committed suicide. It has been heavily implied that her death was a result of Haber‚Äôs insistence to continue his work. Nonetheless, Haber stayed resolute in his fight for Germany, and he delayed no time working to implement his studies into new weapons.
</p>
<p>
After the war Haber received many commendations for his efforts despite his grief over Germany‚Äôs loss. Haber remarried Charlotte Nathan, and had two more children. But, the two divorced in 1927.
</p>
<p>

Haber remained in a stalemate with his career and reputation for years. With the rise of the Nazi‚Äôs, Fritz Haber had gone from the German patriot into ‚Äúthe Haber Jew‚Äù. As a christian convert, Haber was only exempt from civil service, but many of the jewish scientists and militants he worked with, were dismissed from their jobs. Haber took a silent stand against the antisemetic principles of Hitler‚Äôs policies, choosing to resign, because he didn‚Äôt believe in the unfair judgement Nazi‚Äôs held.
</p>
<p>
He went into exile, and in 1934, Fritz Haber died alone in a hotel room in Switzerland. As Germany descended into war years later, Haber‚Äôs old concepts were still used and reworked. The invention of Zyklon Bthe principal gas used during the Holocaust, was credited to Haber.
