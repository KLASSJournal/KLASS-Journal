            May 4th most likely would‚Äôve been a regular Tuesday for most of you; nothing much really happened, school, Covid I guess. But to many people around the world, it was a day of solidarity and celebration, because it was Star Wars day.
            </p>
            <p>
            May 4th is widely regarded around the world as being Star Wars day. The date being chosen as ‚Äúmay the fourth'' sounds a lot like ‚Äúmay the force (be with you)‚Äù, the popular saying from the movies. The day is usually full of star wars themed events and celebrations, and despite Covid, this year wasn't without its festivities.

            Going back in time to the first recorded use of the term ‚ÄúMay the fourth'' will take us to Margaret Thatcher's electoral win in 1979, when the London Evening News was quoted saying ‚ÄúMay the Fourth Be with You, Maggie. Congratulations.‚Äù Despite the early use of the saying, the day was largely overshadowed by ‚ÄúStar Wars Celebration‚Äù, a convention held in America every year since 1999. The first recognised Star Wars day celebration however was in 2011, when the Toronto Underground Cinema held activities and events to celebrate May the 4th.

            This year's May 4th came along with the long awaited Bad Batch series. The show is a follow up to the season 7 finale of the legendary Clone Wars series that ended last year. The show follows a team of elite clones as they go on adventures fighting against the evil empire. Unlike other squadrons of clones that appear in Star Wars however, the members of the Bad Batch all have their own special mutations which give them unique abilities. Fun fact: Since all the clones have the same voice actor, the Bad Batch is no different, with Dee Bradley Baker voicing all 5 of the main cast. You can catch the show now, streaming on Disney plus!

            <p> You might be thinking, what's the big deal? The thing is, Star Wars is simply unlike anything out there. Its deep lore and very interactive community has made the franchise more than just a movie franchise, it's a way of living for many, including myself, unashamedly.

            Poverty affects children more than any other people. Children are more than twice as likely to live a poverty stricken life than adults and they die at twice the rate of their better-off peers. Worldwide more than 1 billion are multidimensionally poor; deprived of basic necessities including education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation or water.

            Star Wars drastically changed the trajectory of humankind. Its impact on movies and pop culture is unrivalled (like what even is Star Trek??), with its countless references and thriving community, there truly isn‚Äôt a fan base like it. Star Wars brought upon massive strides in not only culture but in visual effects, revolutionising techniques like the dykstraflex, blue screen tech and LED virtual production used to film The Mandalorian. Star Wars isn‚Äôt just a franchise, it's an experience. So raise your blasters, your lightsabers, or your thermal detonators in unity; <a style = 'color:red'> may the force be with you.</a>
