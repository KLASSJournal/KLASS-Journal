The start of the year has been a blast for toy giant Lego as they close in on the end of their winter release wave. Tons of new sets have been released this season with 26 new City sets, 8 new Star Wars sets, the Lego Ideas Medieval Blacksmith and many others. Truly noteworthy sets this season were the wildly successful 10280 Flower Bouquet and the 10295 Porsche 911 from the Creator Expert line. Lego has introduced new and exciting things this season and they are not to be missed out on.

Okay... I take back what I said about new and exciting as the 2021 Porsche 911 is Lego‚Äôs eighth iteration of the iconic sports car. The car, based on models from the 70s, includes brand new specialised elements to match the iconic Porsche design Language. A cool feature about the set is it allows the builder to choose between building the convertible Targa or the classic Turbo. The set releases on March 1st, check out the designer video <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eHWmLu7Td8&feature=youtu.be' style='color:red'> here </a>.

Riding on the heels of the historic 501st Battle pack from last year, Lego Star Wars has introduced a brand new scale for their iconic ships. Three new sets: Luke‚Äôs X Wing, the TIE Fighter and the Imperial Shuttle have all been released in a new smaller scale compared to their predecessors. This bold move allows for prices to drop, making these memorable spacecraft more affordable and accessible to the masses. The smaller scale also makes these sets child friendly, exposing a whole new generation to the wonders of Star Wars. However, this move has garnered criticism from Star Wars fanatics who see these new sets as inaccurate representations of their favourite movie props although Lego seems to be unphased, with a rumoured Slave 1 releasing in the smaller scale later this year.

What could by far be the biggest change this year is Lego‚Äôs unexpected shift to a new buildable road plate system. Previously, Lego had used specialised baseplates that were compatible with other baseplates, like the ones found in the Modular series. This new road system consists of grey 16 x 16 squares that are two plates tall. The new system has faced apprehension by Lego fans as the roads are an awkward half plate taller than a paved modular baseplate. Lego seems confident in their decision, marketing the new system heavily and incorporating these roads in many City sets released in the past 3 months.
